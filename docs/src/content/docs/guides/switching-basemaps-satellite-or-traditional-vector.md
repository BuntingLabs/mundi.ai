title: Switching Basemaps (Satellite / Vector)
description: Change the basemap between satellite and traditional vector on Mundi cloud / on-premise
---

:::note
Open source Mundi only supports OpenStreetMap basemaps because there are no free satellite imagery providers.
:::

Mundi provides multiple basemaps to help you visualize your data with
different contextual backgrounds. By default, Mundi displays a traditional
vector basemap. You can easily switch to a satellite imagery view for a more
photorealistic context.

## Toggling basemaps

1.  To switch basemaps, locate the **Toggle satellite** button in the top right
    corner of the map view. It is represented by a globe icon.

2.  Click the globe icon. The basemap will instantly switch to a satellite
    imagery view.

You can click the same icon again at any time to toggle back to the
traditional vector basemap.
