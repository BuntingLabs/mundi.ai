[Mundi](https://github.com/BuntingLabs/mundi.ai) is an open source, AI-native GIS. Mundi is available on our hosted cloud service at [app.mundi.ai](https://app.mundi.ai)
and is self-hostable under the AGPLv3 license. Give us a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/BuntingLabs/mundi.ai),

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Starting on Mundi cloud

You can sign up for free at [app.mundi.ai](https://app.mundi.ai) to try out Mundi.

We have a set of [guides](./guides) that walk through sample use cases of Mundi. I recommend ["Making your first map"](./getting-started/making-your-first-map)
as a starter tutorial.

## Self-hosting Mundi

Mundi is open source (AGPLv3) and can run entirely on your local machine with local LLMs. I'm still working on instructions
and tutorials for how to self-host, but it will involve using ollama for LLM inference, probably one of Mistral's models,
and will require Docker compose.
